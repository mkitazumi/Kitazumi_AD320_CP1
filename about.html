        This summer I spent a lot of time focusing on bettering myself mentally. Also trying to reflect on what I want to achive in this lifetime.
        What I'm looking foward to doing in AD 320 is exploring more paths I can take so more doors can open.

        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this

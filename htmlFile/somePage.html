            If you are using leftover chicken with bones: boil chicken with some ginger and garlic. 
            Boil till meat is falling off bones. Drain broth into another pot and pick off meat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soak vermicelli in a container with water. Make sure the water is above the noodles.
            The noodles will soak up a lot of water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over mediumheat in chicken broth add shoyu, sugar, garlic ginger. 
            If you are using chicken thighs then add them in now. 
            Add in salt and pepper to taste.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Fish out chicken when the meat is done cooking. Turn stove to low. Shred meat and discard bones.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the chicken is shredded, add back into pot with vermicelli noodles and cook for about
            5 minutes or when noodles are done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When serving, garnish with chopped green onions.
